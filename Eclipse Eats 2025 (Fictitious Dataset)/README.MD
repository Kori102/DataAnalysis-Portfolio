# Eclipse Eats: Delivery Operations Analysis

## Workbook Context & Analytical Focus

**"üòã Eclipse Eats"**

Eclipse Eats is a fictional international brand I created for a university course project, where I designed its identity, logos, and mockups. The concept features worldwide late-night restaurants delivering unique food and munchies between 00:00‚Äì4:00, offering 30 permanent menu items and 10 rotating daily specials.

**üí° The key goal for ‚ÄúEclipse Eats‚Äù will be optimizing delivery operations to ensure profitability and customer satisfaction.**

**üìí The Workbook**

The dataset I built using ChatGPT is a realistic simulation of an international food delivery company. It includes order-level data that captures the essentials of running such a business: when and where orders happen, how deliveries perform, what customers buy, and how much money flows in. Each record connects timing, geography, customer behavior, and financial details, creating a complete picture of operations. This structure makes the file a strong foundation for exploring questions any business would care about - like demand patterns, late deliveries, popular items, or order value, and for practicing how to turn raw information into clear insights through analysis and dashboards.

## üì¢ Executive Summary

The analysis revealed three clear, high-impact opportunities to drive growth for Eclipse Eats. By focusing on customer frequency, delivery efficiency, and intelligent menu bundling, ‚ÄúEclipse Eats‚Äù can significantly increase revenue and improve customer satisfaction.

**1. Focus on Order Frequency, Not Just Order Value.**

Our customers spend roughly the same amount per order ($3 variance) regardless of segment. The real growth lever is getting them to order more often.

**‚úÖ Action:** Retain Eclipse Eats‚Äô most frequent customers (Club-Goers & Gamers) with loyalty programs. Nurture Students & Night-Shift Workers with targeted meal plans and unlock the high-potential Local Residents by testing family-bundle offers to increase their low purchase frequency.

**2. Optimize Deliveries with a "Smart Fleet".**

Delivery lateness is driven by a mismatch between vehicle, distance, and weather. A one-size-fits-all approach is failing.

**‚úÖ Action:** Implement a dynamic dispatch system. In rain, automatically assign scooters for short trips (to avoid parking delays) and cars for long trips (for reliability). This will immediately reduce late orders and improve the customer experience.

**3. Increase Average Order Value with Intelligent Bundling.**

Customer purchasing data shows clear patterns. The ‚ÄúIonian Ice Pop‚Äù is a universal add-on, and the Lagrange Lasagna is a common meal anchor.

**‚úÖ Action:** Program the app to offer smart, automated bundles. When a customer adds Lasagna, prompt them to add a side. When they order a snack, suggest the Ice Pop. These simple "meal deals" and "sweet duos" will drive incremental revenue on every transaction.

## The Dashboard

![Dashboard.png](attachment:16ff0c12-07df-47b2-943e-0092f1218dbd:Dashboard.png)

**üìà For the full interactive Tableau dashboard [click here](https://public.tableau.com/views/EclipseEats-Updated/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

The core questions this dashboard answers include:

- **Which customer segments drive AOV for unique items and which segments place the most distinct orders that include unique items?**
  This question helps us see which types of customers spend the most on special menu items and which types of customers buy them most often, so we can understand who really drives sales of the unique dishes at Eclipse Eats.

- **How do distance, vehicle, and weather affect late deliveries?**
  This question helps us understand in simple terms whether the chances of food arriving late depend more on how far it needs to travel, which type of vehicle delivers it, or what the weather is like.

- **Which items co-occur and should be bundled?**
  This question helps the business discover which foods customers often buy together so they can be offered as bundles that make ordering easier and increase sales.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation Plan

üí° For this, I created a new sheet called `Clean_Data`, to keep a backup of the original raw data.

![image.png](attachment:468753cb-1d91-43a2-99d1-8ea6861d893d:image.png)

### üìä Make time usable across time zones

**WHY‚ùì**
All analyses hinge on the 00:00‚Äì04:00 local window. Text timestamps break time math and cross-TZ comparisons.

**HOW‚ùì**
Converted `Local_Datetime` from text to true Date/Time via **Data ‚Üí Text to Columns ‚Üí Delimited ‚Üí Date (YMD)**.

**Validation:**
Spot checks with `=ISNUMBER()`.

### üìä Numeric hygiene for money fields

**WHY‚ùì**
Prices, tips, and discounts must be numeric to avoid silent errors in totals.

**HOW‚ùì**
Temporary checks with `=ISNUMBER(ref)`. Where needed, removed stray symbols and standardized decimals. For readability in the *clean view* only, applied currency format (raw values remain plain numbers).

**Validation:**
Random row audits and quick distribution scans (e.g., tips not negative). By doing so, I prevented aggregation errors and made finance metrics trustworthy.

### üìä Promo intensity: `Discount_Rate`

**WHY‚ùì**
I wanted a quick signal for promotions relative to basket value.

**HOW‚ùì**
New column `Discount_Rate = IF(Items_Value>0, Discount/Items_Value, 0)` formatted as % (display only).

**Validation:**
Looked for outliers (>100%) to catch data issues. It gave me a fast way to segment orders by promo pressure and spot abnormal rows.

### üìä Financial consistency check

**WHY‚ùì**
Ensure `Total_Order_Value` matches the arithmetic `Items_Value + Tip ‚Äì Discount`.

**HOW‚ùì**
`Financial_Validation = ROUND([@[Items_Value]] + [@Tip] - [@Discount], 2) = ROUND([@[Total_Order_Value]], 2)` and filtered to `FALSE`.

**What I Found:**
A cluster of `FALSE` rows where `Total_Order_Value` was effectively zero because **Discount > Items_Value**.

**Decision:**
Logged as **Data Quality Issue #1** and flagged these orders. For analysis:
- Excluded them from revenue KPIs (to avoid inflating promo losses).
- Kept them in operational metrics (they still affect load, delivery, etc.).

This prevented downstream margin distortion and documented a business rule candidate (cap discounts at basket value or record excess as ‚Äúpromo credit‚Äù).

### üìä Time logic sanity: `Delivery_Time_Min ‚â• Prep_Time_Min`

**WHY‚ùì**
Delivery should include prep; violations indicate entry errors.

**HOW‚ùì**
`Time_Validation = [@Delivery_Time_Min] >= [@Prep_Time_Min]`.

**What I Found:**
**4 rows (0.07%)** were `FALSE`, clustered in **Singapore, Jerusalem, and LA**.

**Decision:**
Logged as **Data Quality Issue #2** and **removed** them (tiny share, clearly illogical). This removed noise from SLA distributions and average delivery time metrics.

### üìä Analysis helpers (readability + segmentation)

**Has_Daily_Unique:**
- **WHY‚ùì** Easily segment orders containing a rotating daily special.
- **HOW‚ùì** `=IF([@Daily_Unique_In_Order]=1,"Yes","No")`. It provided clear pivots on the performance of limited-time items.

**Distance_Bucket:**
- **WHY‚ùì** Turn skewed continuous `Distance_km` into actionable bands.
- **HOW‚ùì** `=IF([@[Distance_km]]<=1,"Short (<1km)",IF([@[Distance_km]]<=3,"Medium (1‚Äì3km)","Long (>3km)"))`. It provided crisp comparisons of ETA, tips, and on-time rates by trip length.

### üìä Count all items per order

**WHY‚ùì**
Pivot analysis showed `Items_Count` stuck at `0`, even when multiple items were ordered. This column should represent the **sum of Item1_Qty, Item2_Qty, and Item3_Qty**, but blank cells prevented totals.

**HOW‚ùì**
In `Clean_Data`, replaced static `0` with a structured reference formula in the `Items_Count` column:
```excel
=SUM([@[Item1_Qty]], [@[Item2_Qty]], [@[Item3_Qty]])
Validation:
Spot-checked rows: orders with Item1_Qty=2, Item2_Qty=1, Item3_Qty=0 ‚Üí Items_Count=3. Confirmed pivot values update correctly.
üìä Compute daily-unique item quantities
WHY‚ùì
KPIs for the ‚Äúdaily menu‚Äù under-counted demand. We only had a boolean Daily_Unique_In_Order, but not quantities per slot. We need per-slot quantities that treat blanks safely and follow the SKU rule: permanent items start with ‚ÄúP‚Äù; any other prefix = daily unique.
HOW‚ùì
Added three new columns in Clean_Data, each returning the qty only when the item is a daily-unique; otherwise 0.
code
Excel
' Daily_Unique_Qty_1
=IFERROR(IF(ISERROR(SEARCH("P",[@[Item1_ID]])), [@[Item1_Qty]], 0), 0)

' Daily_Unique_Qty_2
=IFERROR(IF(ISERROR(SEARCH("P",[@[Item2_ID]])), [@[Item2_Qty]], 0), 0)

' Daily_Unique_Qty_3
=IFERROR(IF(ISERROR(SEARCH("P",[@[Item3_ID]])), [@[Item3_Qty]], 0), 0)
Then, I created a new column Total_Daily_Unique_Items in Clean_Data:
code
Excel
=IF([@[Has_Daily_Unique]]="Yes", [@[Daily_Unique_Qty_1]]+[@[Daily_Unique_Qty_2]]+[@[Daily_Unique_Qty_3]], 0)
Validation:
Spot-checks:
Item1_ID="B12", Item1_Qty=2 ‚Üí Daily_Unique_Qty_1=2
Item2_ID="P07", Item2_Qty=1 ‚Üí Daily_Unique_Qty_2=0
Blank Item3_* ‚Üí Daily_Unique_Qty_3=0 (via IFERROR).
Confirmed pivot totals for daily uniques now match manual sums.
Data Quality Log
Issue	Description	Investigation	Action Taken
Financial Mismatch	Total_Order_Value = 0 while Items_Value + Tip ‚Äì Discount > 0; discounts exceeded basket value	Filtered FALSE in Financial_Validation; confirmed arithmetic	Flagged; excluded from revenue KPIs; proposed discount cap rule
Logical Time Error	4 rows where Delivery_Time_Min < Prep_Time_Min (0.07%)	Concentrated in Singapore, Jerusalem, LA	Deleted rows
Items Count Incorrect	Items_Count = 0 for all rows despite item quantities present	Found formula missing aggregation across Item1‚Äì3	Replaced with =SUM([@[Item1_Qty]],[@[Item2_Qty]],[@[Item3_Qty]]); validated with sample rows
Result
After these steps, the dataset is type-correct, auditable, and analysis-ready. The checks are lightweight, reproducible, and documented. Most importantly, they protect core metrics - on-time performance, revenue, and promo efficiency, so insights reflect operations, not artifacts.
Answering Key Business Questions for Eclipse Eats
Q1 - Which customer segments drive AOV for unique items and which segments place the most distinct orders that include unique items?
![alt text](attachment:102432dc-5447-4811-a5a7-4c3ea1e4f287:Q1.png)
Insights & Recommendations
No single segment truly drives AOV. The difference between the highest and lowest AOV is only $3. This suggests that when customers decide to order a special, they tend to build a cart of similar total value. Therefore, focusing on increasing AOV may be less effective than focusing on increasing order frequency.
The segments that place the most orders including unique items are the Club-Goers (130 orders) and Gamers (118 orders). Following them, Students and Night-Shift workers form a reliable secondary tier with 91 and 85 orders respectively.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Retain the highest-volume segments, Club-Goers and Gamers, by implementing gamified loyalty programs and curating menu specials that appeal directly to their lifestyles.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Increase the low order frequency of high-spending Local Residents by first analyzing their basket size to determine if they need premium single-meal promotions or family-bundle offers.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Nurture the Students and Night-Shift segments into core customers by promoting study-group bundles to increase average order value and offering weekly meal plans to boost their purchase frequency.
Q2 - How do distance, vehicle, and weather affect late deliveries?
![alt text](attachment:c808d6a5-16b1-481d-9228-71232a2dda7f:6708fee0-0cbc-47da-8766-90e8850b63c0.png)
Insights & Recommendations
Short Distance: The 7.5% lateness rate for cars in the rain suggests the issue is parking and building access, not travel speed. Bikes and scooters are far more efficient for these trips.
Medium Distance: In clear weather, cars are least efficient (9.2% late). In rain, cars become the most reliable option (9.0% late), while bike and scooter performance degrades.
Long Distance: Cars are the clear winner in adverse conditions. In rain, the car lateness rate (37.7%) is substantially lower than for bikes (54.1%) and scooters (52.1%).
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: A fleet heavily reliant on scooters is optimal for urban areas where most deliveries are likely short-to-medium distance.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: ‚ÄúEclipse Eats‚Äù needs to automatically assign the smartest vehicle for every order. When it rains, scooters are best for short trips while cars are much better for long ones.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: For long-distance deliveries in the rain, be upfront with customers, provide a longer, more realistic delivery time, and consider temporarily pausing deliveries to faraway places during bad weather.
Q3 - Which items co-occur and should be bundled?
![alt text](attachment:ae231b81-f0db-4fd9-8238-d3ada739245d:Q3.png)
Insights & Recommendations
The Ionian Ice Pop appears in many order pairs, making it an excellent cross-sell item with both sweet and savory foods.
The Lagrange Lasagna is a primary main course that customers often build their meals around.
Customers typically order in two patterns: a full meal (main dish + extras) or a snack/dessert combo.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Create special bundles like a "Sweet Duo" or a "Meal Deal" to simplify choices and increase average order value.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Implement smart suggestions in the app. When a customer selects the Ice Pop or Lasagna, prompt them to add a matching item.
‚û°Ô∏è Recommendation: Test different bundle offerings to see which perform best, tracking customer adoption, order completion rates, and profitability.
