# üìä Data Insights & Analytical Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio repository.  
This repository showcases two complete analytics projects built from the ground up, combining **data cleaning**, **preparation**, **visual exploration**, and **insight generation**. Each project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into clear, actionable business intelligence through structured analysis and visualization.

---

## üß† Overview

This repository reflects my work in **end to end data analysis**, featuring:

- Building structured datasets from raw or simulated information  
- Applying systematic data cleaning and validation techniques  
- Designing reproducible analytical frameworks using both **SQL** and **spreadsheet-based logic**  
- Translating insights into **business recommendations** and **strategic decisions**  
- Developing visual dashboards to communicate results effectively  

Both projects here share a common approach grounded in analytical discipline, reproducibility, and storytelling through data.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository includes two main folders, each representing a complete analysis:

- **Eclipse Eats Analytics**  
  A full business intelligence case built around a fictional late-night restaurant delivery brand.  
  It explores customer segmentation, delivery optimization, and intelligent product bundling, combining operational data with strategic recommendations.  

- **Theme Park Visitors SQL Analysis**  
  A structured SQL exploration of theme park visitor data focusing on demographic patterns, promotion effectiveness, and seasonal crowd behavior.  

Each project folder includes:
- Cleaned and validated datasets  
- Workbooks or SQL scripts used in exploration  
- Analytical frameworks and dashboards  
- Executive summaries and actionable business insights

## üìà Analytical Capabilities Demonstrated

### Data Cleaning and Quality Control
Every project begins with establishing **data reliability** through:
- Field type validation and numeric hygiene checks  
- Logical and financial consistency tests  
- Custom data quality logs documenting all identified issues and corrections  

### Analytical Framework Design
Each analysis follows a structured series of **guiding questions**:
- Who are the customers or visitors?
- When and where does key activity occur?
- What behaviors drive engagement and revenue?
- How do external factors like weather or promotions influence outcomes?

### Insight Generation
Results focus on **translating analytical findings into strategic recommendations** such as:
- Optimizing delivery logistics with smart fleet assignment  
- Increasing order frequency through loyalty and bundling  
- Identifying key visitor demographics and high performing promotions  
- Shaping crowd management and seasonal marketing strategy  

### Visualization and Communication
Both projects feature visual outputs designed for clarity and decision making, including:
- Tableau dashboards and Excel visuals  
- SQL driven metrics summaries  
- Charts highlighting performance trends, distribution patterns, and correlations
